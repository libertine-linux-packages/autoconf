# autoconf for Libertine Linux

## License

* The license for this package is MIT.
* The license for the upstream source autoconf-2.13 is GPL2.
* The license for the upstream sources autoconf-2.64 and autoconf-2.69 is GPL3.
* The license for the replacements files is GPL2.

## Notes

* The files in `replacement-files` were copied from a working autoconf installation and tweaked. At some point it would be nice to generate them. What would be even nicer would be to put autoconf out to grass.
